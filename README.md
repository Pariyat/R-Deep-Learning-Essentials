# R Deep Learning Essentials

This repository contains the code used in the book R Deep Learning Essentials. The official code can be downloaded on the [packt support website](https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/support). 

This was the first time I saw an author using the checkpoint package to make sure the code is reproducible. More information about the checkpoint package can be found on [cran](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/checkpoint/index.html).
